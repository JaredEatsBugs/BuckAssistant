CSE 5339 - Intermediate Studies in Algorithms


Description
Intermediate-level topics in algorithms. Repeatable to a maximum of 12 cr hrs. Class Notes: Undergrads: please contact the instructor to ask to be added to this class.Title: Optimal Transport in Machine Learning and Shape Analysis (OTMLSA)Description: Optimal transport problems arisen the work of the french mathematician Gaspard Monge in the late 1700s. The original formulation was meant to model the optimal way of moving goods from a collection of sources to a collection of distribution points. The formulation was subsequently improved by the economist Leonid Kantorovich in the mid 1900s who found a more efficient linear programming relaxation. In recent years ideas from optimal transport have been applied to problems in machine learning and geometric shape processing. This course will first cover the main ideas/concepts related to optimal transport, and will then explore several of its modern applications to ML and SA. Prerequisites: familiarity with discrete math/structures and interest in/familiarity with basic machine learning and shape analysis concepts.
